# Data_analytics_on_industrial_security_clearance_adjurations
The research project aims to analyze and extract useful information from the "DOD Clearance Adjudications" dataset to train a machine learning model for industrial security clearance determination.
Tested the effectives of the machine learning model using sentimental analysis and NLP.
Interpreted and visualized a predictive model which was trained and tested using decision tree classifier.
What do you learn from this?
a.	Is there any possibility of deploying developed machine learning algorithm practically? 
b.	Does this developed model can be more robust by handling the raw data as input? 
c.	Can sentimental analysis be performed on the developed algorithm?
